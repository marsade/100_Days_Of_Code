# Day 20 - Snake Game (Part 1)

## Overview

There are 7 steps to making the snake game
- Create a snake body: Line 3 boxes up next to each other to make the body of the snake.
- Move the snake: Figure out how to move the snake.
- Create snake food: Make the food for the snake.
- Detect collision with food: Know when the snake has 'eaten' the food
- Create a scoreboard: Keep track of the score
- Detect collision with wall: End the game when the snake collides with a wall.
- Detect collision with tail: End the game when the snake collides with itself.

In this first part of building the snake game, we will focus on the first three steps.
