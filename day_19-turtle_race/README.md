# Day 19 - More Turtle Graphics, Evemt Listeners, State and Multiple Instances

## Overview
### Functions as an input
We have function_a...
```
def function_a(something):
	# Do this
	# Then do this
```
Then we have funciton_b...
```
def function_b():
	# Do this
```
We can pass function be into function a like so...
```
	function_a(function_b)
```
When we pass the function as an input, we only pass the name and not the parantheses. In python this is called a **higher order functions**
